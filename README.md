# Linux based server/client custom TCP protocol networking solution
This repository is a resource for a blog post I am working on that breaks down how to do some basic networking with byte streams and decoding/encoding with network to host order and the other way around.
The scope of this project is limited to focus on how to connect two sockets, both running on Linux (I am using arch for setting this up, but the distro is irelevant here), that can both encode, send and decode data types such as string, int, float, boolean and bytes.

If you see no link to the blog post as of reading this, that means the blog post is still work in progress and not yet published.
